# Calculator Project
## This repository contains the source code for a basic yet fully functional calculator application. The calculator is designed to perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to run in any modern web browser.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear and Reset Functionality: Easily clear the current entry or reset the entire calculation.
- Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Keyboard Support: Perform calculations using both mouse clicks and keyboard input.
- Error Handling: Displays error messages for invalid operations, such as division by zero.
# Usage
## Performing Calculations
- Click on the number buttons to enter your desired values.
- Choose an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /) for your calculation.
- Click on another number to complete the operation.
- Press the = button to see the result.
- Use the C button to clear the current entry or the AC button to reset the entire calculation.
# Keyboard Shortcuts
- Numbers (0-9): Enter digits directly using the keyboard.
- Operators: Use +, -, *, / for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.
-Enter: Calculate the result (equivalent to =).
- Backspace: Delete the last entry.
- Escape: Reset the calculator (equivalent to AC).
 # Testing
- Cross-Browser Testing
  Ensure that the calculator functions correctly in different browsers by testing it in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

- Mobile Responsiveness
 Use browser developer tools or physical devices to check the calculator’s performance on mobile screens.

- Edge Cases
 Test various edge cases such as dividing by zero, entering multiple operators consecutively, and clearing the calculator in the middle of an operation.
# Troubleshooting
- Common Issues
- Buttons Not Responding: Ensure that the JavaScript file (script.js) is correctly linked in the index.html file.
- Incorrect Calculations: Double-check the order of operations in the JavaScript code to ensure calculations are performed correctly.
- Styling Not Applied: Make sure the CSS file (styles.css) is linked properly, and that there are no syntax errors in the CSS.
